# Apple-Music-Library-Analysis

Do you ever have doubts about the accuracy of your streaming habits on Apple Music Replay? Fear not, because you now have the power to analyze your own library and create customized charts using this GitHub repository. Inspired by Jeff's article on Medium about [iTunes Library analysis using Pyhon](https://leojosefm.medium.com/python-analyzing-itunes-library-97bec60e13cb), I've taken the idea even further by developing a fully automatic pipeline for analyzing your music habits, made possible by the invaluable [music-library-exporter](https://github.com/kylekingcdn/music-library-exporter) script developed by kylekingcdn. With the following user-friendly instructions, you can dive right in and start exploring your Apple Music library in no time. 

## Installation
First, clone this Github repo in a local folder 
```
git clone https://github.com/mirko-leccese/Apple-Music-Library-Analysis.git
```
You will get a copy of the current GitHub repository, with the following content:
- ```LIBRARIES```: Our Apple Music Library information are saved as an XML file on our Mac. We are going to save our exported XML files in this folder called *LIBRARIES*, organized in distinct years subfolders.
